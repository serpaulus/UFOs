## Summary
The page is set-up to capture UFO enthusiast interest by allowing them to easily research various sittings. However, the welcome statement “Ufologists Weigh In” creates the expectation that the visitor will have an opportunity to comment. I recommend for that a visitor comments features get added. Another recommendation is to add citations or links to the information sources, this would not only add research credibility but entice more user engagement.
